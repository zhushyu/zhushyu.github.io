gCASTLE: A Causal Structure Learning Toolchain
---
- Together with many colleagues of Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, we have built a causal structure learning toolchain containing various functionalities related to causal learning and evaluation. 
- The package offers a number of causal discovery algorithms, most of which are gradient-based, hence the name: **g**radient-based **Ca**usal **st**ructure **le**arning pipeline.
